# Maven Movies SQL Data Analysis Project
Leveraged my SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database to answer the potential Acquirerâ€™s questions. Each question required 
me to write a multi-table SQL query, join multiple tables, use multiple case statements etc. 

During this SQL project, I gained a firm grasp of intermediate SQL concepts such as JOINS, CASE statements, UNION, GROUP BY, and AGGREGATION, along with STRING functions. I successfully applied multiple JOINS to connect tables and utilized multiple CASE statements to analyze and manipulate the data effectively. These experiences enhanced my understanding of SQL and allowed me to perform comprehensive data analysis.
